# Effective Knowledge Management From Article Creation to Approval

## Project Overview
  The "Effective Knowledge Management: From Article Creation to Approval" project focuses on streamlining the process of creating, reviewing, and approving knowledge articles within the ServiceNow platform. The primary challenge this project addresses is the lack of a systematic, efficient approach to generating high-quality, useful knowledge content for end-users. By leveraging ServiceNow's robust capabilities in content management, the project aims to enhance user experience, increase accessibility to solutions, and reduce the number of support tickets by providing high-quality documentation and guidance in a timely manner.
## Goal:
  Deliver a streamlined, comprehensive solution that improves operational efficiency, enhances user engagement and self-service capabilities, and supports the organizationâ€™s long-term vision for a knowledge-driven environment.
## Objectives
### Business Goals:
  - Minimize the volume of support tickets by increasing self-service resolution rates.
  - Standardize the knowledge article creation and approval process to maintain high-quality content.
  - Foster a culture of continuous improvement in knowledge sharing and accessibility.
### Specific Outcomes:
  - Creation and deployment of a defined workflow for article creation, review, and approval.
  - Enhanced end-user experience through accurate, relevant, and easily searchable content.
  - Reduction in ticket backlog due to more self-resolved incidents.
